## Installation

torch can be installed from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("torch")
```

You can also install the development version with:

```r
remotes::install_github("mlverse/torch")
```

At the first package load additional software will be 
installed. See also the full [installation guide](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/articles/installation.html) here.

## Examples

You can create torch tensors from R objects with the `torch_tensor` function and convert them back to R objects with `as_array`.

```{r}
library(torch)
x <- array(runif(8), dim = c(2, 2, 2))
y <- torch_tensor(x, dtype = torch_float64())
y
identical(x, as_array(y))
```

### Simple Autograd Example

In the following snippet we let torch, using the autograd feature, calculate the derivatives:

```{r}
x <- torch_tensor(1, requires_grad = TRUE)
w <- torch_tensor(2, requires_grad = TRUE)
b <- torch_tensor(3, requires_grad = TRUE)
y <- w * x + b
y$backward()
x$grad
w$grad
b$grad
```

## Contributing

No matter your current skills it's possible to contribute to `torch` development.
See the [contributing guide](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/contributing) for more information.
