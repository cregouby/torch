## Overview

The torch R package is composed of multiple abstraction layers until R code finally
calls LibTorch code. Depending on which part of the code you want to modify you
might need different build requirements for setting up. 

Because of some special requirements the project has, it's not always possible to
use the standard `devtools` tools to work on torch. This guide is intended for contributors to the torch codebase to quickly get set up and be able to modify the source code without spending too much time
understanding the internals.

The torch R package is composed of the following layers, going top down:

1. R code calling `torch_` functions.
2. R code calling `cpp_torch_` functions.
3. Rcpp (C++) code calling `lantern_torch_` functions.
4. Lantern (C++) code calling LibTorch functions.

Depending on the function 2, 3 and 4. might be auto-generated (via the tools/torchgen) package or not.
In the next sections we will explain how to contribute code depending on the layer you are modifying.

## R source code

Modifying R source code should be the simplest case and it shouldn't be required for
contributors to other tools than the standard R development toolbox (like RTools on Windows and
a C++ compiler on MacOS).

The standard `devtools` should just work too. Ie, you can clone the project from GitHub,
modify R source code, including documentation and run `devtools::load_all()`

The first time you run `devtools::load_all()`, the torch installation prompt will appear
and LibTorch and lantern binaries will be downloaded and installed inside the `inst`
directory of your installation. Subsequent calls will work as expected.

> **Note** loading torch twice without restarting the R session causes the session
to **crash**. Unbfortunatelly we don't know yet how to fix this bug and it's related
to problems with correctly unloading shared libraries. So you should **restart**
your session before calling `devtools::load_all()` again. Also **note** that other functions might call `devtools::load_all()` internally, like eg. `devtools::test()` and `devtools::document()`.

Also, running **Build** or **Check** in the RStudio pane will fail, as it calls Rcpp::CompileAttributes without calling the `Makevars` file instructions, that are required for torch to work correctly.

If you use `devtools::check()` pass the argument `devtools::check(document=FALSE)`.
The reason for this is described below.

### Documentation 

torch registers a few roxygen2 roclets to handle examples and sessions in roxygen2
documentation. Unfortunately we are unaware of any method to automatically register
these roclets without messing with the DESCRIPTION's collate field.

The recommended way to update documentation in torch is by using the `tools/document.R` script. You can either call `source("tools/document.R")` or, the recommended, run:

```
Rscript tools/document.R
```

in your terminal. This has the advantage that since `devtools::document()` is called
internally and it calls `pkgload::load_all()`, that won't crash your R session if you
forget to restart your session (see note above).

## Rcpp code

Modifying Rcpp source code in `src` should be very similar to modifying C++ in other
R packages. 

You should pay attention when calling `lantern_*` functions though. Most `lantern_*`
functions return `void*` that will leak the referring objects if they are not correctly
freed after use. The best way to handle them is to always assign them to a variable
with the correct type defined in `inst/include/torch_types.h` specially those defined
in the C++ `namespace torch {}`. If you use these kind of objects you also gain
the ability to return them to R without having to write custom Rcpp code as for most of
them we have implemented the `SEXP()` operator.

## Lantern code

In order to modify the Lantern source code you will first need to make sure
the environment variable `BUILD_LANTERN` is set to `1`. To avoid forgetting to set
it you can add it to your `.Renviron` using, eg `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

That flag will trigger the `configure` file to call the `lantern` target in Makevars.
Building lantern requires CMake to be in your path. You can install CMake in all
major platforms by following instructions in the [install page](https://cmake.org/install/).

When `BUILD_LANTERN=1` and you run `devtools::load_all()`, Lantern will be compiled
as part of that workflow. You will see a new directory called `build-lantern` in your
package directory containing files related to the Lantern build.

Lantern source code is located in `src/lantern/src`. The lantern CMakeLists file
is located at `src/lantern/CMakeLists.txt`. You can also take a look at the `lantern` target in `src/Makevars.in` to get a sense of what CMake commands are called when building Lantern from source.

By default, rebuilding Lantern is incremental, ie, calling `devtools::load_all()`
will only rebuild modified parts of the Lantern code. Depending on the extend of your modifications in Lantern source code you might need to completely clean the build directory, you can do it by simply removing the `build-lantern` directory.
